## Introduction: World University Rankings
This is a great dataset available through [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings#).

* 3 sources of rankings are included: Times rankings, center for world university rankings, and Shanghai rankings.

* We will spend sometime on data cleaning and visualization.

* Use PCA to see which covariates drive the rankings the most. Indeed, we could use principal component regression, using the PCA scores as covariates in the model.

* Barro-Lee Dataset on Educational Attainment.


## Setup
``` {r libraries, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(maps)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

## Fix school and country names

Load the `world.cities` dataset from package `maps`.

```{r loadcities}

## Then assign countries to Shanghai dataset.
```{r asgncntry}

# Now strip down the unassigned schools to just the place/name and see if a school with an assigned country
# also has the same place/name and therefore belongs to the same country.

## Combine Rankings

Combine the rankings into a single data.frame

```{r combine, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 11, fig.height = 9}
countries <- timesdf$country %>% 
  union( cwurdf$country ) %>% 
  union( shanghaidf2$country ) %>% 
  sort %T>% print
```

## Combine Rankings

```{r}

## If we only want to see the top-100 rankings:
```{r}

## Visualize Combined Data

Just a quick check on what we've got. Rankings color-coded by country.

```{r pltcombo, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}

gplt.times <- tmp.times %>% 
  dplyr::select(1:3,year,contains('rank')) %>% 
  filter(year == iyr,qrank.times>0.9) %>% 
  mutate(institution = factor(institution,levels=unique(institution)[order(qrank.times,decreasing=TRUE)])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=institution,y=qrank.times,fill=country)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,hjust=1.0)) + labs(title = sprintf('Times World Rankings %d',iyr))

gplt.cwur <- tmp.cwur %>% 
  dplyr::select(1:3,year,contains('rank')) %>% 
  filter(year == iyr,qrank.cwur>0.9) %>% 
  mutate(institution = factor(institution,levels=unique(institution)[order(qrank.cwur,decreasing=TRUE)])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=institution,y=qrank.cwur,fill=country)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,hjust=1.0)) + labs(title = sprintf('CWUR World Rankings %d',iyr))

  filter(year == iyr,qrank.shanghai>0.9) %>% 
  mutate(institution = factor(institution,levels=unique(institution)[order(qrank.shanghai,decreasing=TRUE)])) %>%

```


## Bayesian Plackett-Luce Modeling to infer institution strengths from rankings

- Starting with the combo top-100 rankings, combo100df, convert into an ordering matrix with the appropriate covariate matrices for X, country, source, year.

- Here, we'll use the inverse-logistic (effectively, log-odds) of the quantiles of each 
variable from the 3 ranking sources (Times, CWUR, Shanghai). This is convenient since some of the variables are scores and others are rankings.  
```{r conversion1}
a <- combo100df %>% 
  dplyr::select(-contains('score')) %>% 
  mutate(schoolID  = as.integer(factor(institution)),
         countryID = as.integer(factor(country)))
```
## Getting the covariates, X
```{r}
medianMLT <- function(x) median(x,na.rm=TRUE)
instX <- a %>% 
  group_by(institution) %>% 
  summarize_each(funs(medianMLT),teaching:countryID) %>%
  inner_join(a %>% dplyr::select(country,countryID) %>% distinct,by='countryID')
```
Variable `femaleProp` has `NA` for quite a few institutions, so we'll drop it.
In order to retain institutions like Columbia U. and Purdue U., we'll drop the `income` column.

```{r dropit}
instX %<>% dplyr::select(-femaleProp,-income)

# *************************************************
# ***Drop any row with 6 or more missing values.***
# ***THIS DROPS ANY UNIVERSITY THAT DIDN'T SHOW ***
# *** UP ON AT LEAST TWO OF THE RANKING LISTS   ***
# *************************************************
instX %<>% filter(apply(.,1,function(x) length(which(is.na(x)))<6))
# We'll drop these schools too.
instX %>% filter(!complete.cases(.)) %>% print
instX %<>% filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  mutate(
    country     = factor(as.character(country)),
    countryID   = as.integer(country),
    institution = factor(as.character(institution)),
    schoolID    = as.integer(institution)
  )
a     %<>% filter(institution %in% instX$institution) %>% 
  mutate(
    country     = factor(as.character(country)),
    countryID   = as.integer(country),
    institution = factor(as.character(institution)),
    schoolID    = as.integer(institution)
  )
```

This leaves `r nrow(instX)` institutions.


## Continue with the column conversions...
```{r conversion2}
# Convert all columns into log-odds of empirical CDF.
# The rankings variables are negated so that less negative values are better (or could have reversed the ranking values if 
# wanted to keep everything positive).
negate <- function(x) -x
makeBayesFactors <- function(x) qlogis(rank(x)/(length(x)+1))
instX %<>% 
  mutate_each(funs(negate),one_of('quality_of_education','alumni_employment','quality_of_faculty','publications','influence','citations_cwur','patents')) %>%
  mutate_each(funs(makeBayesFactors),-institution,-country,-schoolID,-countryID) %>% 
  dplyr::select(institution,country,schoolID,countryID,everything())

# So this is now our design matrix of covariate values. 
# One row for each of the 113 institutions, and one column for each
# of the 15 covariates we've decided to keep.
X <- instX %>% 
  arrange(schoolID) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-institution,-schoolID,-country,-countryID) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-citations_cwur) %>% # Also drop citations_cwur because have citations_times
  as.matrix
rownames(X) <- instX %>% arrange(schoolID) %$% { institution %>% as.character }
```

## Visualization of the Covariates

We use principal components analysis (PCA) to display the level of correlation amongst the covariates and to hint at which might drive the rankings the most.

Considering that Harvard, Stanford and MIT are near the top of all of the rankings, we expect that the biplot indicates `influence`, `research`, `hici`, `quality_of_education`, `quality_of_faculty`, `alumni` and `award` to have high potential as drivers of the rankings.

## Visualization of the Covariates

```{r pcaX, fig.width = 11, fig.height=8}
xpca <- princomp(X, cor = FALSE)
plot(xpca)
```

## Visualization of the Covariates
```{r}
biplot(xpca)
```

## PCA results
```{r}
print(xpca)
```

## PCA results with names
```{r}
scl2char <- function(x) {xmax<- x[which.max(abs(x))]; if(xmax<0) fctr<- -1 else fctr <- 1; ifelse(abs(x)>0.25,sprintf("%4.2f",fctr*x),"")}
xpcachar <- xpca$loadings %>% matrix(nrow=nrow(.),dimnames=dimnames(.)) %>%
  as.data.frame %>% 
  tbl_df %>% 
  mutate_each(funs(scl2char)) %>% 
  mutate(X=rownames(xpca$loadings)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(X,everything()) %T>% print(width=Inf)

X <- xpca$scores %>% apply(2,function(x) {xmax<- x[which.max(abs(x))]; if(xmax<0) fctr<- -1 else fctr <- 1; fctr*x })

## Stack all the columns across the years into a `Year` and `Value` column (using `tidyr::gather()`).

```{r}

## Barro-Lee Data

There's quite a bit of information to work through in this dataset.  We began by breaking off chunks and transforming and plotting them to get a feel for what the
data were saying. Let us first look at the Barro-Lee average years of schooling and population data.
```{r bldf}
bldf <- attaindf %>% filter(grepl('^Barro',series_name))
```

## Average years of schooling
```{r}
bldfay <- bldf %>% filter(grepl('Average years',series_name)) %>%
  mutate(
    source = 'Barro-Lee',
    type = "Average years of schooling",
    schoolLevel = factor(gsub('.+ ([^ ]+) schooling.+','\\1',series_name),levels=c('primary','secondary','tertiary','total')),
    ageCohort   = factor(gsub('.+, age ([^,]+),.+','\\1',series_name)),
    gender      = factor(gsub('.+, ([a-zA-Z]+)$','\\1',series_name))
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-series_name)
```

## Proportions finished schooling
```{r}
bldfpf <- bldf %>% filter(grepl('Percentage of',series_name)) %>%
  mutate(
    Value = Value/100,
    source = 'Barro-Lee',
    type = "Proportion with schooling",
    schoolLevel = factor(gsub('.+\\with (.+)$','\\1',series_name),
                         levels=c(
                           'no education',
                           'primary schooling. Completed Primary',
                           'primary schooling. Total (Incomplete and Completed Primary)',
                           'secondary schooling. Completed Secondary',
                           'secondary schooling. Total (Incomplete and Completed Secondary)',
                           'tertiary schooling. Completed Tertiary',
                           'tertiary schooling. Total (Incomplete and Completed Tertiary)'
                         )
    ),
    ageCohort   = factor(gsub('.+ age ([^ ]+) .+','\\1',series_name)),
    gender      = factor(ifelse(gsub('.+Percentage of ([a-zA-Z]+) .+','\\1',series_name)=='population','total','female'))
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-series_name)
```

## Population
```{r}
bldfpop <- bldf %>% filter(grepl('Population',series_name)) %>%
  mutate(
    source = 'Barro-Lee',
    type = "Population in thousands",
    ageCohort   = factor(gsub('.+, age ([^,]+),.+','\\1',series_name)),
    gender      = factor(gsub('.+, ([a-zA-Z]+)$','\\1',series_name)),
    population  = Value*1000
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-series_name,-Value)

bldfay %<>% inner_join(bldfpop %>% dplyr::select(-source,-type), by = c("country_name","Year","ageCohort","gender"))
bldfpf %<>% inner_join(bldfpop %>% dplyr::select(-source,-type), by = c("country_name","Year","ageCohort","gender"))
```

## Plot out the data to get a feel for its structure and message.
```{r usplots1, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
country <- "United States"
bldfay %>% 
  filter(
    country_name == country,
    !grepl('15\\+|25\\+',ageCohort)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Value, color = gender)) + 
     geom_line() + labs(y = 'Average Years of Schooling', title = country) +
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
     facet_wrap(schoolLevel~ageCohort, nrow = 4)
```
