## Qualitative variables

Let's think about variables that take on discrete qualitative values.

- Race/Ethnicity information in census data

- Allele at different positions in the genome

- Animal species in a national park

How can we define summaries for these?

Specifically, how can we think of **center** and **spread**?

## Diversity

When dealing with a qualitative variable, rather then "spread" we talk about diversity.

Let's say that we have data in the following form
$$\begin{array}{cccc}
v_1 & v_2& \cdots & v_m\\
p_1 & p_2 &\cdots & p_m
\end{array}
$$
where $v_1,\ldots, v_m$ are the different modalities of the variable (ex. "Asian","Black","Hispanic","White") and $p_1,\ldots,p_m$ the relative frequencies with which they are observed in the data ($p_1+p_2+\cdots+p_m=1$)

- What would be the value of $p_1,\ldots,p_m$ that correspond to the least diversity?

- How about the value of $p_1,\ldots,p_m$ that correspond to the most diversity?

## Another comparison

Say that population 1 is such that
$$\begin{array}{cccc}
v_1 & v_2& \cdots & v_m\\
\frac{1}{m} &  \frac{1}{m} &\cdots & \frac{1}{m}
\end{array}
$$
And population 2 is
$$\begin{array}{cccc}
w_1 & w_2& \cdots & w_k\\
\frac{1}{k} &  \frac{1}{k} &\cdots & \frac{1}{k}
\end{array}
$$
Which of the two populations is more diverse if $k\leq m$?

## An index of diversity

Now that we have some practice in thinking about diversity, let's see if we can come up with an "Index" for diversity.

$$\begin{array}{cccc}
v_1 & v_2& \cdots & v_m\\
p_1 & p_2 &\cdots & p_m
\end{array}
$$
$$D= ?$$

Imagine you go fishing and you are going to get a sense of the diversity of the fish population in the lake from the first two fish that you capture


## One proposal

$$D= 1-\sum_{i=1}^mp_i^2$$

- Probability that if you capture two fishes they are not the same.

## Verifying that the index does what we want
$$D= 1-\sum_{i=1}^mp_i^2$$

- $0\leq D \leq 1$

- $D=0$ if one  $p_i=1$

- Let's calculate the value of the index when $p_1=p_2=\cdots=p_m=\frac{1}{m}$
$$
\sum_{i=1}^mp_i^2  = \sum_{i=1}^m(\frac{1}{m})^2= m\frac{1}{m^2}=\frac{1}{m}$$
So, that the diversity $1-\displaystyle \frac{1}{m}$ is larger the larger is $m$

- $D=1$ when there are an infinite number of species

## Notes

- We really should verify that for a population with $m$ modalities, $D\leq 1-\frac{1}{m}$

- This index is known as Gini (again!) or Simpson's diversity index (be careful that actually there are multiple versions of the Simpson index)

- There are other measures of diversity. Most importantly one known as Shannon's index that is based on **entropy**

$$H= -\sum_{i=1}^mp_i\log(p_i)$$

## Gini (Shannon) index in genetics

- When analyzing data relative to the frequency of different alleles in genetics, the $D=1-\sum_{i=1}^mp_i^2$ is preferred

- This is because it has a very easy genetic interpretation: it represents the **probability of an heterozygous genotype**.

- Genetic diversity is connected to the size/age of the population: over time, more mutations can appear and can become reasonably frequent.

## Human Genome Diversity Panel

The [Rosenberg Lab Website](https://rosenberglab.stanford.edu/diversity.html)
makes available a lot of data collected over the years on human genetic diversity.

In one study published in 2002, the scientific team collected data on

- 377 genetic markers
- in 52 human populations
- for a total of 1056 individuals

We dowloaded information on the allele frequencies of each of these markers and each of these populations and studied their diversity.
