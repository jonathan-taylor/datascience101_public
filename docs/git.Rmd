1. Go in the git directory. You can go down as much as you want. Any
   git command will recognize what you have done

2. At the beginning of a session to make sure you have all the changes
that have been applied so far. Note that you will only do this once if
you have not already cloned the repo.


```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git fetch
git pull â€”rebase
```

## Checking the current status.

The following command will alert you at what changes have happened so far

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git status
```
This will also tell you on which branch of the repository you are on,
etc.

## Updating, adding files

You have to tell `git` about any files you have added or modified by
means of the `git add` command. The format is:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git add <stuff>
```
You can use the traditional unix shortcuts to name them all. Note that
directories can also be added.

This step merely stages the files; that is, it tells git that these
are files you want committed. But you have to actually commit them,
per the next section.

Some useful commands in (what I think) typical frequency of use. On
the command line, I recommend using the full word versions below as
they aid memory.

- To stage all modified, newly added (untracked) files, but ignoring
deleted files, use:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git add .
```

- To stage all modified and removed files, ignoring newly added files,
use:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git add --update
```
or equivalently

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git add -u
```

- To stage _all_ files, including modified, newly added, and deleted
files, use:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git add --all
```
or equivalently
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git add -A
```


If you are unsure, note that you can always add `-n` to all these
options so that you can get a _dry run_ without anything actually
happening. Once you have checked things are ok, you can then remove
the `-n` option.

## Committing

The commit command is below. What follows `-m` is a comment indicating
what the commit was about.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git commit -m "last version of PCA3"
git push
```

The last `push` command ensures that the changes were actually pushed
to the remote directory since our repository is remote, not local. At
this point, if the commit you made is to the master branch, you should
see it in a browser at the
[Data Science 101 Repo](https://bitbucket.org/jetaylor74/datascience_101).

## Create a new branch

This section is how I (Naras) usually operate within the Emacs'
_Magit_ mode, but I don't think it necessary that others do so and so
you may choose to ignore everything below.

I create a branch whenever I want to make some feature changes.
Making changes in my branch is a good way to create my edits away
from the `master` branch.

If you don't use branches, you are working directly with the `master`
branch.

To create a new branch, I execute

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git branch mybranch
```
which creates a local branch named `mybranch`.

Now I have to inform the remote repo that I have a new branch as shown
below.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git push --set-upstream origin mybranch
```

Now I can do all my work with my branch as follows, first by checking
it out.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git checkout mybranch
```

I then make my changes as usual and do commits and push changes
upstream as outlined earlier.  When I push my branch to the remote
repo, I am provided with a button to create a `pull` request on the
website.  This pull request (different from `git pull`) is a request
to merge the branch into the master. I have to approve it and in the
process resolve any conflicts that may arise. Once it is approved,
stuff from my branch, gets merged into the master branch.

Once done with a branch, I can delete it.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git branch -d mybranch
```
This does not affect the changes that have already been merged into
the master via my pull request.
